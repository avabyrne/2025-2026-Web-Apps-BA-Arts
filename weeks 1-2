	<h1>Lost City Cat</h1>
	<h2> By Hy Sobiloff </h2>
	<br> Lost city cat
	<br> Paws brush
	<br> Awakens unwritten music
	<br> Unravels an alley's tone
	<br> Encounters a strange foe
	<br> Country forest.
	<br>
	<br> A Cat's meow its true calling
	<br> Sprawls, paws, stalking its only instinct 
	<br> Ears wiggling for a sound
	<br> Night its eyes
	<br> Food its wisdom
	<br> Near each noise
	<br> It springs in silence.
